# Resume Builder Script

The Resume Builder script is a Python script that helps users create a simple resume in Google's XYZ format. It prompts the user to input personal information, skills, interests, and work experiences. The script then exports the resume as a plain text file.

Google's XYZ format is a method for describing your work accomplishments in a clear and concise way by focusing on three key components:

-   **X: The task or situation you were involved in.** This part should provide context for the specific challenge or problem you encountered. It helps the reader understand the background of the project or task and the scope of the issue you were addressing.
-   **Y: The actions or steps you took.** In this section, describe the specific actions or steps you performed to tackle the task or solve the problem. Be specific and focus on your direct contribution, as this will showcase your skills, expertise, and initiative.
-   **Z: The results or impact of those actions.** This is where you outline the outcomes of your efforts. Highlight quantifiable achievements, such as increased revenue, decreased costs, improved efficiency, or other key performance indicators that were positively impacted by your actions.

Using the XYZ format helps present your work experience in a way that emphasizes your individual contributions and the results of your efforts. It enables potential employers to better understand the value you can bring to their organization.
